# LLM Summarizer Showdown

A web application that allows users to compare summaries generated by different language models side by side and rate their performance.

## Features

- Compare summaries from different LLMs (OpenAI and HuggingFace models)
- Rate summaries based on clarity, accuracy, and conciseness
- View statistics and performance metrics
- Modern, responsive UI built with React and Chakra UI

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key (for GPT models)
- HuggingFace API key (for open-source models)

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App
